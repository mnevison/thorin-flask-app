  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of
      the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of
      the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
      While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
      fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at
      some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death

    <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. <br />
      Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and
      in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that
      Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and
      his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and
      survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely
      Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
      company of Thorin.

    <h3>Gloin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was
      the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. <br />
      In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar,
      the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown
      how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. <br />
      In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born
      to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin
      Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
      reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf
      mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that
      Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest
      dragonet new from the shell".

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the
      dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those
      driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
      Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
      Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
      Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
      Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

    <h3>Dwalin</h3>
    <p>
      Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor,
      Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin
      II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
      <br />
      Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others
      accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim
      Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA
      2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered
      under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search
      for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him
      the news.

    <h3>Ori</h3>
    <p>
      Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years,
      alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
      member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo
      Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain,
      culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of
      Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he
      survived.

    <h3>Dori</h3>
    <p>
      It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in the tunnels of the Misty
      Mountains during the escape from the Goblins, but Dori dropped Bilbo, and
      the other Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar."
      Later, during their escape from the Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo
      climb a tree to get away from the wargs. Bilbo shortly thereafter saved
      Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and
      taken to the Great Shelf from the Misty Mountains. When Gandalf tells
      their tale to the skin-changer Beorn and brings forward the company, Dori
      came first, along with Thorin.

<div class="row featurette">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <h3>Nori</h3>
    <p>
      In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and
      Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of
      Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in
      Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to
      climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize that Bilbo had been
      left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued
      Bilbo. <br />
      Nori did little to distinguish himself during the Dwarves's adventures in
      the wild, though he shared the same array of experiences as the others of
      the Company: captured in turn by Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, and Elves, they
      eventually reached the distant Lonely Mountain and recovered it for
      Durin's Folk. <br />
      Nori fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and returned to the
      Lonely Mountain where he established himself and grew rich. During the War
      of the Ring, Nori was still living in the Lonely Mountain, and possibly
      fought in the Battle of Dale against the Easterlings.

    <h3>Bifur</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not
      related to the royal House of Durin. Most of his familial relations are
      unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
      family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon
      Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as
      a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in
      the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

    <h3>Bofur</h3>
    <p>
      While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the
      meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He
      accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company
      across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves'
      treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur
      participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his
      fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon.

    <h3>Bombur</h3>
    <p>
      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of
      Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the
      Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
      between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
      of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured,
      Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born
      in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior
      to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
      Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
      Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He
      was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the
      beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he
      became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was
      associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took
      him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves,
      but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
      fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he
      followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the
      Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of
      despair.<br />
      When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to
      Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord
      Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the five to be sent. At
      first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of
      Sauron. Manwë understood, and told Olórin that such was a reason why he
      should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing
      much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë
      insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to
      send Olórin as the second instead. He agreed, and prepared for Olórin's
      departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the
      same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

    <h3>Bilbo</h3>
    <p>
      In the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf, whom
      he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf
      invited Bilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the
      hobbit, who bade the wizard a "Good morning", and went inside. Undeterred,
      Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin II,
      to Bag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for
      their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had
      himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the Dwarves' job. The
      Dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were
      among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from the Lonely Mountain
      when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had
      determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a "burglar" to help them in
      situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next
      morning they set off from the Green Dragon Inn. <br />
      Thorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and
      beside castles. After approximately one month since their outset, Gandalf
      disappeared. Óin and Glóin failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and
      Balin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and
      sent Bilbo to investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert,
      and William. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring
      back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However,
      he was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all
      the Dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him.
      Fortunately for the Dwarves, Gandalf returned and saved them all by
      imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with one
      another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone.<br />
      The Hobbit wallpaper 48 Bilbo as portrayed by Martin Freeman After
      rescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the Trolls'
      lair, which the trolls had used to hide their treasure and shield
      themselves from the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number
      of weapons were found, Glamdring (Beater) and Orcrist (Biter) among them.
      Bilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a
      small knife in size, which he would later name Sting. He kept it with him
      for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.<br />
      In June the company came to Rivendell. During their visit, Bilbo met Lord
      Elrond, and became enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond
      inspected the swords of Thorin and Gandalf and looked at Thrór's Map,
      which Gandalf had previously given to Thorin at the behest of Thorin's
      father Thráin II. Elrond explained that the swords were forged in Gondolin
      and were named Orcrist and Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found
      Moon-letters that spoke of the Side-door of Erebor, which read: Stand by
      the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last
      light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.
